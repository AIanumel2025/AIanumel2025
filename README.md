<< Hello there 👋! I am Anthony, a Microsoft Certified Data Analyst and MSc AI candidate. I love to create practical python programs with procedural code to enhance the quality of my life and hopefully yours. I am currently working on the following:
1. Data extraction and analysis for model training.
2. Building data pipelines to extract image and text based data from various sources to run a model-trained educational app
3. Exploratory data analyses of large datasets to derive insights, to ultimately prepare them for AI model training. >>

<<   Your contributions are valuable and welcome. Feel free to explore all my projects/repositories. >>
