<< Hello there 👋! I am Anthony, a Microsoft Certified Data Analyst and MSc AI candidate. I love to create practical python programs with procedural code to enhance the quality of my life and hopefully yours. I am currently working on the following:
1. Exploratory data analyses of large datasets to derive insights, and ultimately prepare them for AI model training.
2. Web scrapping for data analysis, to extract data to train AI models. >>

<<   Your contribution is immensely valuable and welcome. Feel free to explore all my projects/repositories. >>
