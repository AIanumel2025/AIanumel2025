<< Hello there 👋! I am Anthony, a Microsoft Certified Data Analyst and MSc AI candidate. I love to create practical python programs with procedural code to enhance the quality of my life and hopefully yours. I am currently working on the following:
1. Web scrapping for data extraction and analysis needed to train AI models.
2. Exploratory data analyses of large datasets to derive insights, to ultimately prepare them for AI model training. >>

<<   Your contribution is immensely valuable and welcome. Feel free to explore all my projects/repositories. >>
